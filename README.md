<p class="subtitle">An Introduction to Unix Systems for the Cautious and Weary</p>

Many think they know Unix.
Few realize that what they know is just a shell.
Beneath it lie mysteries both bewildering and wonderful:
ports, processes, permissions,
files that are not files,
and components built atop other, older components
that occasionally rise to the surface like ancient sea creatures believed long extinct.

Like such creatures,
Unix will outlive those who mock it.
Welcome, then, to a world in which the strange will become familiar, and the familiar, strange.
Welcome, thrice welcome, to Unix systems programming.
