<p class="subtitle">An Introduction to Unix Systems for the Cautious and Weary</p>

Many think they know Unix.
Few realize that what they know is just a shell.
Beneath it lie mysteries both bewildering and wonderful:
ports, processes, permissions,
files that are not files,
and components built atop other, older components
that occasionally rise to the surface like ancient sea creatures believed long extinct.

Like such creatures,
Unix will outlive those who mock it.
Welcome, then, to a world in which the strange will become familiar, and the familiar, strange.
Welcome, thrice welcome, to Unix systems programming.

These lesson notes and examples are for instructors to use as a starting point.
We do *not* expect novices with only basic Python and Unix experience to be able to learn from this on their own.
As a musical analogy,
these notes are the chord changes and melody;
we expect instructors to create an arrangement and/or improvise over the material
when delivering it.
Please see [*Teaching Tech Together*][t3] for background.
