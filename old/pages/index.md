[% section_break class="aside" title="Scope" %]

-   [Intended audience][persona]
    -   Ning did a bachelor's degree in economics
        and now works as a data analyst for the Ministry of Health
    -   They learned Python in an intensive 16-week data science bootcamp program
        and are comfortable working with Unix command-line tools,
        writing data analysis programs in Python,
	and downloading data from the web to use in those programs
    -   Ning wants to build real-time dashboards for people in the Ministry,
        but doesn't understand how to do that
	without exposing confidential data or opening the Ministry up to attack
    -   Their work schedule is unpredictable and highly variable,
        so they need to be able to learn a bit at a time

-   TODO:
    -   what to teach about Docker and why?
    -   what to teach about continuous integration, using what system?
    -   what to teach about batch jobs, using what system?
    -   what to teach about cron jobs (if anything)?
    -   what if anything to teach about networking, firewalls, certificates, etc.?

[% section_break class="aside" title="What We're Going to Do" %]

1.  Show how the basic components of the web work.
1.  Build a simple application that serves up data from files and a database.
1.  Fix its safety issues one by one.
1.  Along the way, introduce ideas about processes, file systems, certificates, and related topics.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="aside" title="Setup" %]

-   Download [the latest release]([% config "release" %])
-   Unzip the file in a temporary directory to create:
    -   `./src/*.*`: shell scripts and Python programs
    -   `./site/*.*`: the pages and data files used in the examples
    -   `./out/*.*`: expected output for examples

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Securing the Server" %]

-   Two components
    -   Give the server a [%g digital_certificate "digital certificate" %] so that it can establish its identity
    -   Have the client communicate with it via [%g https HTTPS %] (the encrypted version of HTTP)
-   Certificate has private and public components
    -   Answer questions with '.' to skip
    -   `-nodes` is short for "no DES" so there isn't an interactive password on the certificate

[% single "src/create_pem.sh" %]
[% single "site/server_first_cert.pem" %]

-   Modify file server to listen for secure connections on port 1443
    -   [%g wrap_object "Wrap" %] the server's [%g socket "socket" %] with a layer of security
    -   Everything else stays the same

[% single "src/file_server_secure.py" keep="main" %]

-   Run it like this

[% single "src/file_server_secure.sh" %]

-   Point browser at `https://localhost:1443/motto.txt`
    -   Must have *both* `https` *and* the port `1443`

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Securing the Client" %]

-   Try `requests.get("https://localhost:1443/test.txt")`

[% single "out/requests_secure_no_verify.out" %]

-   Fair enough: `requests` shouldn't trust self-signed certificates by default
-   Can tell it not to check at all by passing `verify=False` but turning off security is a bad idea
-   Try `requests.get("https://localhost:1443/test.txt", verify="cert.pem")`
    -   I.e., pass it the server's certificate

[% single "out/requests_secure_server_cert.out" %]

-   What we actually need is to sign the server's certificate with a certificate from some authority,
    then tell `requests` it can use the authority's certificate to check the server's certificate
    -   Seems roundabout, but it allows us to use a few hundred trusted certificates to check everyone else's
-   `import certifi` and `certifi.where()` to see the PEM file that `requests` uses by default

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Starting Over" %]

-   Pretend to be our own [%g certificate_authority "certificate authority" %] (CA)
-   Use our CA certificate to [%g digital_signature "sign" %] the server's certificate
    -   We can use the CA to sign any number of certificates

[% single "src/create_signed_cert.sh" %]

-   Run the server with the newly-created certificate

[% single "src/file_server_signed.sh" %]

-   Point `requests` at the CA certificate
    -   Which it then uses to check that the server's certificate is properly signed

[% single "src/requests_signed_cert.py" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="aside" title="This Is Hard" %]

-   It took a full day and help from three other people to get this working
-   And I'm still not sure what these commands used to sign the server certificate are for

[% single "src/extfile.txt" %]

-   Some of this difficulty is intrinsinc: security really is hard
-   Some is accidental complexity introduced by evolution over time

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="aside" title="Processes" %]

-   We've been running clients and servers interactively
-   How can we automate this?
    -   The heart of [%g deployment "deploying" %] applications
-   A [%g process "process" %] is a running instance of a program
    -   Code plus variables in memory plus open files plus some IDs
-   Tools to manage them were invented when most users only had a single terminal
-   Some repurposed, some replaced: result is unfortunately as messy as certificates

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Viewing Processes" %]

-   Use `ps -a -l` to see currently running processes in terminal
-   Or `ps -a -x` to see (almost) all processes running on computer
    -   `UID`: numeric ID of the user that the process belongs to
    -   `PID`: process's unique ID
    -   `PPID`: ID of the process's parent (i.e., the process that created it)
    -   `CMD`: the command the process is running

[% multi "src/ps_a_l.sh" "out/ps_a_l.out" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Signals" %]

-   Can send a [%g signal "signal" %] to a process
    -   Something extraordinary happened, please deal with it immediately

| Number | Name      | Default Action    | Description |
| -----: | --------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
|      1 | `SIGHUP`  | terminate process | terminal line hangup |
|      2 | `SIGINT`  | terminate process | interrupt program |
|      3 | `SIGQUIT` | create core image | quit program |
|      4 | `SIGILL`  | create core image | illegal instruction |
|      8 | `SIGFPE`  | create core image | floating-point exception |
|      9 | `SIGKILL` | terminate process | kill program |
|     11 | `SIGSEGV` | create core image | segmentation violation |
|     12 | `SIGSYS`  | create core image | non-existent system call invoked |
|     14 | `SIGALRM` | terminate process | real-time timer expired |
|     15 | `SIGTERM` | terminate process | software termination signal |
|     17 | `SIGSTOP` | stop process      | stop (cannot be caught or ignored) |
|     24 | `SIGXCPU` | terminate process | CPU time limit exceeded |
|     25 | `SIGXFSZ` | terminate process | file size limit exceeded |

-   Create a [%g callback_function "callback function" %] to act as a [%g signal_handler "signal handler" %]

[% multi "src/catch_interrupt.py" "out/catch_interrupt.out" %]

-   `^C` shows where user typed Ctrl-C

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Background Processes" %]

-   Can run a process in the [%g process_background "background" %]
    -   Only difference is that it's not connected to the terminal

[% multi "src/show_timer.py" "src/show_timer.sh" "out/show_timer.out" %]

-   `&` at end of command to run `show_timer.py` means "run in the background"
-   So `ls` command executes immediately
-   But `show_timer.py` keeps running until it finishes
    -   Or needs keyboard input
-   Can also start process and then [%g process_suspend "suspend" %] it with Ctrl-Z
    -   Sends `SIGSTOP` instead of `SIGINT`
-   Use `jobs` to see all suspended processes
-   Then <code>bg %<em>num</em></code> to resume in the background
-   Or <code>fg %<em>num</em></code> to [%g process_foreground "foreground" %] the process
    to [%g process_resume "resume" %] its execution

[% single "src/ctrl_z_background.sh" %]

-   Note that input and output are mixed together
-   One of our goals is to build something that will re-run something like this
    *and* show input and output in the order a user would see them
    *while also* labeling input and output correctly

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Killing Processes" %]

-   Use `kill` to send a signal to a process
    -   Not necessarily to stop it

[% single "src/kill_process.sh" %]

-   By default, `kill` sends `SIGTERM` (terminate process)
-   Variations:
    -   Give a process ID: `kill 1234`
    -   Send a different signal: `kill -s INT %1`

[% single "src/kill_int.sh" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Redirection" %]

[% todo "Explain redirection of standard error (with diagrams)" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Running Processes Together" %]

-   Want to run a client and server side by side and capture their output
-   First attempt: start the server, wait one second, and run the client
-   When the client finishes, stop the script and its children
    -   Shuts down the server and anything else that may have started

[% single "src/run_2_sleep.sh" %]

-   Use this for the first script and something similar for the second

[% single "src/run_2_left.sh" %]

-   Run it

[% multi "src/run_2_example.sh" "out/run_2_example.out" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="aside" title="Partial Ordering" %]

-   There are *choose(x+y, x)* ways to interleave two sequences of length *x* and *y*
-   Which is *(x+y)!/x!y!*
-   So two programs that open a file, write a line, and close the file
    can be interleaved in 20 different ways
-   A [%g robustness "robust" %] application works in all 20 ways
    -   Because sleeping for one second is no guarantee
        that another process has run far enough to open a socket

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="aside" title="Listing Open Files" %]

-   Unix tries hard to make (almost) everything look like a file
    -   Read/write as [%g stream "stream" %] or in [%g block_device "blocks" %]
-   In particular, a socket makes a network connection look like a file
-   Use `lsof` to list open files
    -   Operating system keeps track of what "files" a process is interacting with
    -   So we can ask it

[% multi "src/run_lsof.sh" "out/run_lsof.out" %]

-   Which means we can start a process and wait until it opens a particular port

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="A Better Runner" %]

[% single "src/run_and_wait.sh" %]

-   There's a lot going on here
    -   Shell functions
    -   Using `shift` and `$!` to handle arguments
    -   Using `trap` to handle interrupts
    -   Using `printf` instead of `echo`
-   The most important part is the `while` loop
    -   `await_port_listen` function waits for someone to listen to a port
-   We can either learn a new language (shell scripting)
    or figure out how to do this in Python

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Introducing FastAPI" %]

[% single "src/bird_server_fastapi.py" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="At a Lower Level" %]

[% double stem="socket_server" suffix="py out" %]

-   A [%g socket "socket" %] is a channel between two computers
    -   Makes network I/O look (sort of) like file I/O
-   Our server handles a single request by:
    -   Waiting for a connection
    -   Creating a `Handler` object
    -   Calling its `handle` method
-   And then it closes
-   It responds to requests with an HTTP "OK"

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Sending an HTTP Request" %]

[% double stem="socket_client" suffix="py out" %]

-   Connect to a local server
-   Send an HTTP request
    -   Verb: `GET`
    -   Path: `/motto.txt`
    -   HTTP version
    -   One header identifying the host (because a single address might be home to several)
-   Read data back
    -   First chunk of reply is standard HTTP response with lots of headers,
        including length (in bytes) of content
    -   Second chunk is content
-   You can see why we use `requests`, right?

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Secure Sockets" %]

[% double stem="https_client" suffix="py out" %]

-   There's a lot going on here (which is why we use `requests`)
-   Create a socket and wrap it with [%g tls_ssl "TLS/SSL" %] security
    -   Which GitHub requires
-   Like we said, this is why we use `requests`
