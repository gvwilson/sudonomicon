Code uses Source Code Pro and diagrams use Helvetica.

The CSS files used to style code were obtained from [highlight-css][highlight-css].
This site uses the `github` style for [Rouge][rouge];
legibility was checked using [WebAIM WAVE][wave].

Diagrams were created with the desktop version of [draw.io][draw-io].

The site is built using [Jekyll][jekyll]
and hosted on [GitHub Pages][ghp].
Traffic statistics are collected using [plausible.io][plausible],
which provides a lightweight ethical alternative to surveillance capitalism.

The colors in this theme
are lightened versions of those used in
