      Many think they know Unix.
      Few realize that what they know is just a shell.
      Beneath it lie mysteries both bewildering and wonderful:
      ports, processes, permissions,
      files that are not files,
      and components built atop other, older components
      that occasionally rise to the surface like ancient sea creatures believed long extinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like such creatures,
      Unix will outlive those who mock it.
      Welcome, then, to a world in which the strange will become familiar, and the familiar, strange.
      Welcome, thrice welcome, to Unix systems programming.
