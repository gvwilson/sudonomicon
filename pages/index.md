-   [Intended audience][persona]
    -   Ning did a bachelor's degree in economics
        and now works as a data analyst for the Ministry of Health
    -   They learned Python in an intensive 16-week data science bootcamp program
        and are comfortable working with Unix command-line tools,
        writing data analysis programs in Python,
	and downloading data from the web to use in those programs
    -   Ning wants to build real-time dashboards for people in the Ministry,
        but doesn't understand how to do that
	without exposing confidential data or opening the Ministry up to attack
    -   Their work schedule is unpredictable and highly variable,
        so they need to be able to learn a bit at a time

-   Send an [%g http_request "HTTP request" %] for the file we want
-   Server creates a [%g http_response "response" %] that includes the contents of the file

    -   `Content-Length`: number of bytes in response data (i.e., how much to read)
    -   `Content-Type`: [%g mime_type "MIME type" %] of data (e.g., `text/plain`)
-   From now on we will only show interesting headers

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->

-   Better to have the server return data as data
    -   Preferred format these days is [%g json "JSON" %]
    -   So common that `requests` has built-in support
-   There is no standard for representing tabular data as JSON
    -   A list with one list with column names + N lists of values
    -   A list with N dictionaries, all with the same keys
    -   A dictionary with column names and lists of values, all the same length

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->

[% single "src/local_server.sh" %]

-   Pushing files to GitHub so that we can use them is annoying

-   Use Python's [`http.server`][py_http_server] module
    to run a [%g local_server "local server" %]
    -   Host name is [%g localhost "`localhost`" %]
    -   Uses [%g port "port" %] 8000 by default
    -   So URLs look like `http://localhost:8000/path/to/file`
-   `-d site` tells the server to use `site` as its root directory
-   Use this local server for the next few examples
    -   Build our own server later on to show how it works

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Talk to Local Server" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Our Own File Server" %]

[% single "src/file_server_unsafe.py" keep="do_get" %]

-   Our `RequestHandler` handles a single HTTP request
    -   More specifically, handles the `GET` method
-   Combine working directory with requested file path to get local path to file
-   Return that if it exists and is a file or raise an error

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Support Code" %]

-   Send content

[% single "src/file_server_unsafe.py" keep="send_content" %]

-   Handle errors

[% single "src/file_server_unsafe.py" keep="error_page" %]
[% single "src/file_server_unsafe.py" keep="handle_error" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Built-in Safety" %]

-   Modify `requests` script to take URL as command-line parameter

[% single "src/get_url.py" %]

-   Add a sub-directory to `site` called `sandbox` with a file `example.txt`
-   Serve that sub-directory

[% single "src/file_server_sandbox.sh" %]

-   Can get files from that directory

[% multi "src/get_url_allowed.sh" "out/get_url_allowed_server.out" "out/get_url_allowed_client.out" %]

-   But not from parent directory (which isn't part of sandbox)

[% multi "src/get_url_disallowed.sh" "out/get_url_disallowed_server.out" "out/get_url_disallowed_client.out" %]

-   But why not?
-   Looks like `requests` is stripping the leading `..` off the path
-   And if we try that URL in the browser, same thing happens
-   So we're safe, right?

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Introducing netcat" %]

-   [`netcat`][netcat] (often just `nc`) is a computer networking tool
-   Open a connection, send exactly what the user types, and show exactly what is sent in response

[% multi "src/nc_localhost.sh" "src/nc_allowed.text" "out/nc_allowed.out" %]

-   So far so good, but:

[% multi "src/nc_disallowed.text" "out/nc_disallowed.out" %]

-   We shouldn't be able to see files outside the sandbox
-   But if someone doesn't strip out the `..` characters, users can escape

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="exercise" %]

[% exercise %]
The shortcut <code>~<em>username</em></code> means "the specified user's home directory" in the shell,

What happens with each and why?

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="A Safer File Server" %]

[% single "src/file_server_safe.py" keep="handle_file" %]

-   [%g resolve_path "Resolve" %] the constructed path
-   Check that it's below the current working directory (i.e., the sandbox)

[% section_break class="topic" title="Serving Data" %]

-   Rarely have JSON lying around as [%g static_file "static files" %]

[% multi "src/birds_head.sh" "out/birds_head.out" %]

-   Modify server to generate it dynamically
-   Main program

[% single "src/bird_server_whole.py" keep="main" %]

-   Create our own server class because we want to pass the dataframe in the constructor

[% single "src/bird_server_whole.py" keep="server" %]

-   `do_GET` converts the dataframe to JSON (will modify later to do more than this)

[% single "src/bird_server_whole.py" keep="get" %]

-   `send_content` [%g character_encoding "encodes" %] the JSON string as [%g utf_8 "UTF-8" %]
    and sets the MIME type to `application/json`

[% single "src/bird_server_whole.py" keep="send" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Slicing Data" %]

-   URL can contain [%g query_parameter "query parameters" %]
-   Want `http://localhost:8000/?year=2021&species=rebnut` to select red-breasted nuthatches in 2021
-   Put slicing in a method of its own

[% single "src/bird_server_slice.py" keep="get" %]

-   Use `urlparse` and `parse_qs` from [`urllib.parse`][py_urllib_parse] to get query parameters
    -   (Key, list) dictionary
-   Then filter data as requested

[% single "src/bird_server_slice.py" keep="filter" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="exercise" %]

[% exercise %]
Write a function that takes a URL as input
and returns a dictionary whose keys are the query parameters' names
and whose values are lists of their values.
Do you now see why you should use the library function to do this?

[% exercise %]
Modify the server so that clients can specify which columns they want returned
as a comma-separated list of names.
If the client asks for a column that doesn't exist, ignore it.

[% exercise %]
Modify your solution to the previous exercise so that
if the client asks for a column that doesn't exist
the server returns a status code 400 (Bad Request)
and a JSON blog with two keys:
`status_code` (set to 400)
and `error_message` (set to something informative).
Explain why the server should return JSON rather than HTML in the case of an error.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="What's the Magic Word?" %]

-   Only allow access to data if client:
    -   [%g authentication "Authenticates" %] (i.e., establishes their identity)
    -   Is [%g authorization "authorized" %] (i.e., has the right to view the data)
-   Simplest possible is wrong in many ways: does the client know a password?

[% single "src/bird_client_password.py" %]
[% multi "src/bird_client_password_correct.sh" "out/bird_client_password_correct.out" %]
[% multi "src/bird_client_password_incorrect.sh" "out/bird_client_password_incorrect.out" %]

-   First change to server: get the password on the command line and save it

[% single "src/bird_server_password.py" keep="main" %]
[% single "src/bird_server_password.py" keep="server" %]

-   Second change: add authorization to `do_GET`
    -   Once again use our own exception class to handle unhappy cases

[% single "src/bird_server_password.py" keep="get" %]

-   Add authorization that checks header value

[% single "src/bird_server_password.py" keep="auth" %]

-   Handle errors by constructing JSON

[% single "src/bird_server_password.py" keep="error" %]

-   It works but:
    -   One password for everyone
    -   Sent as [%g cleartext "cleartext" %] over an unencrypted connection

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Basic Authentication" %]

    -   Value is <code>Basic <em>data</em></code>
    -   Data is [%g base64 "base-64 encoded" %] <code><em>username</em>:<em>password</em></code>

[% section_break class="topic" title="Securing the Server" %]

-   Two components
    -   Give the server a [%g digital_certificate "digital certificate" %] so that it can establish its identity
    -   Have the client communicate with it via [%g https HTTPS %] (the encrypted version of HTTP)
-   Certificate has private and public components
    -   Answer questions with '.' to skip
    -   `-nodes` is short for "no DES" so there isn't an interactive password on the certificate

[% single "src/create_pem.sh" %]
[% single "site/server_first_cert.pem" %]

-   Modify file server to listen for secure connections on port 1443
    -   [%g wrap_object "Wrap" %] the server's [%g socket "socket" %] with a layer of security
    -   Everything else stays the same

-   Try `requests.get("https://localhost:1443/test.txt")`

[% single "out/requests_secure_no_verify.out" %]

-   Fair enough: `requests` shouldn't trust self-signed certificates by default
-   Can tell it not to check at all by passing `verify=False` but turning off security is a bad idea
-   Try `requests.get("https://localhost:1443/test.txt", verify="cert.pem")`
    -   I.e., pass it the server's certificate

[% single "out/requests_secure_server_cert.out" %]

-   What we actually need is to sign the server's certificate with a certificate from some authority,
    then tell `requests` it can use the authority's certificate to check the server's certificate
    -   Seems roundabout, but it allows us to use a few hundred trusted certificates to check everyone else's
-   `import certifi` and `certifi.where()` to see the PEM file that `requests` uses by default

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Starting Over" %]

-   Pretend to be our own [%g certificate_authority "certificate authority" %] (CA)
-   Use our CA certificate to [%g digital_signature "sign" %] the server's certificate
    -   We can use the CA to sign any number of certificates

[% single "src/create_signed_cert.sh" %]

-   Run the server with the newly-created certificate

[% section_break class="aside" title="Processes" %]

-   We've been running clients and servers interactively
-   How can we automate this?
    -   The heart of [%g deployment "deploying" %] applications
-   A [%g process "process" %] is a running instance of a program
    -   Code plus variables in memory plus open files plus some IDs
-   Tools to manage them were invented when most users only had a single terminal
-   Some repurposed, some replaced: result is unfortunately as messy as certificates

[% multi "src/show_timer.py" "src/show_timer.sh" "out/show_timer.out" %]

-   `&` at end of command to run `show_timer.py` means "run in the background"
-   So `ls` command executes immediately
-   But `show_timer.py` keeps running until it finishes
    -   Or needs keyboard input
-   Can also start process and then [%g process_suspend "suspend" %] it with Ctrl-Z
    -   Sends `SIGSTOP` instead of `SIGINT`
-   Use `jobs` to see all suspended processes
-   Then <code>bg %<em>num</em></code> to resume in the background
-   Or <code>fg %<em>num</em></code> to [%g process_foreground "foreground" %] the process
    to [%g process_resume "resume" %] its execution

[% section_break class="topic" title="Running Processes Together" %]

-   Want to run a client and server side by side and capture their output
-   First attempt: start the server, wait one second, and run the client
-   When the client finishes, stop the script and its children
    -   Shuts down the server and anything else that may have started

[% single "src/run_2_sleep.sh" %]

-   Use this for the first script and something similar for the second

[% single "src/run_2_left.sh" %]

-   Run it

[% multi "src/run_2_example.sh" "out/run_2_example.out" %]

[% section_break class="aside" title="Partial Ordering" %]

-   There are *choose(x+y, x)* ways to interleave two sequences of length *x* and *y*
-   Which is *(x+y)!/x!y!*
-   So two programs that open a file, write a line, and close the file
    can be interleaved in 20 different ways
-   A [%g robustness "robust" %] application works in all 20 ways
    -   Because sleeping for one second is no guarantee
        that another process has run far enough to open a socket

[% section_break class="aside" title="Listing Open Files" %]

-   Unix tries hard to make (almost) everything look like a file
    -   Read/write as [%g stream "stream" %] or in [%g block_device "blocks" %]
-   In particular, a socket makes a network connection look like a file
-   Use `lsof` to list open files
    -   Operating system keeps track of what "files" a process is interacting with
    -   So we can ask it

[% multi "src/run_lsof.sh" "out/run_lsof.out" %]

-   Which means we can start a process and wait until it opens a particular port

[% section_break class="topic" title="A Better Runner" %]

[% single "src/run_and_wait.sh" %]

-   There's a lot going on here
    -   Shell functions
    -   Using `shift` and `$!` to handle arguments
    -   Using `trap` to handle interrupts
    -   Using `printf` instead of `echo`
-   The most important part is the `while` loop
    -   `await_port_listen` function waits for someone to listen to a port
-   We can either learn a new language (shell scripting)
    or figure out how to do this in Python
