[% section_break class="aside" title="Scope" %]

-   [Intended audience][persona]
    -   Ning did a bachelor's degree in economics
        and now works as a data analyst for the Ministry of Health
    -   They learned Python in an intensive 16-week data science bootcamp program
        and are comfortable working with Unix command-line tools,
        writing data analysis programs in Python,
	and downloading data from the web to use in those programs
    -   Ning wants to build real-time dashboards for people in the Ministry,
        but doesn't understand how to do that
	without exposing confidential data or opening the Ministry up to attack
    -   Their work schedule is unpredictable and highly variable,
        so they need to be able to learn a bit at a time
-   Prerequisites
    -   Intermediate Unix command line: `find`, `grep`, shell scripts using `for`
    -   Data analysis with Python: Polars, Plotly, Jupyter notebooks, argparse, regular expressions
    -   Using Git and GitHub on months-long projects with two or three colleagues
-   Learning outcomes
    1.  What it means to deploy an application.
    1.  How to store and access data securely.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="aside" title="What We're Going to Do" %]

1.  Show how the basic components of the web work.
1.  Build a simple application that serves up data from files and a database.
1.  Fix its safety issues one by one.
1.  Along the way, introduce ideas about processes, file systems, certificates, and related topics.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="aside" title="Setup" %]

-   Download [the latest release]([% config "release" %])
-   Unzip the file in a temporary directory to create:
    -   `./src/*.*`: shell scripts and Python programs
    -   `./site/*.*`: the pages and data files used in the examples
    -   `./out/*.*`: expected output for examples

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="aside" title="Start with Something Simple" %]

[% multi "src/requests_get_motto.py" "out/requests_get_motto.out" %]

-   Use the [`requests`][requests] module (needs to be installed)
-   The URL identifies the file we want
    -   Though as we'll see, the server can interpret it differently
-   Response includes:
    -   [%g http_status_code "HTTP status code" %] such as 200 (OK) or 404 (Not Found)
    -   The text of the response

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="aside" title="What Just Happened" %]

[% figure
   file="img/http_lifecycle.svg"
   title="Lifecycle of an HTTP request and response"
   alt="HTTP request/response lifecycle"
%]

-   Open a connection to the server
-   Send an [%g http_request "HTTP request" %] for the file we want
-   Server creates a [%g http_response "response" %] that includes the contents of the file
-   Sends it back
-   `requests` parses the response and creates a Python object for us

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Request Structure" %]

[% multi "src/requests_prepared_structure.py" "out/requests_prepared_structure.out" %]

-   First line is [%g http_method "method" %], URL, and protocol version
-   Every HTTP request can have [%g http_header "headers" %] with extra information
-   And optionally data being uploaded (which we will see later)
-   Yes, it's all just text

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Response Structure" %]

[% multi "src/show_response_headers.py" "out/show_response_headers.out" %]

-   Every HTTP response also has with extra information
    -   Does *not* include status code: that appears in the first line
-   Most important for now are:
    -   `Content-Length`: number of bytes in response data (i.e., how much to read)
    -   `Content-Type`: [%g mime_type "MIME type" %] of data (e.g., `text/plain`)
-   From now on we will only show interesting headers

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="exercise" %]

[% exercise %]
Add header called `Studying` with the value `safety` to the `requests` script shown above.
Does it make a difference to the response?
Should it?

[% exercise %]
What is the difference between the `Content-Type` and the `Content-Encoding` headers?

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="When Things Go Wrong" %]

[% multi "src/get_nonexistent_file.py" "out/get_nonexistent_file.out" %]

-   The 404 status code tells us something went wrong
-   The 9 kilobyte response is an HTML page with an embedded image (the GitHub logo)
-   The page contains human-readable error messages
    -   But we have to know page format to pull them out

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="exercise" %]

[% exercise %]
Look at [this list of HTTP status codes][http_status_codes].

1.  What is the difference between status code 403 and status code 404?

2.  What is status code 418 used for?

3.  Under what circumstances would you expect to get a response whose status code is 505?

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Getting JSON" %]

[% multi "src/requests_get_json.py" "out/requests_get_json.out" %]

-   Parsing data out of HTML is called [%g web_scraping "web scraping" %]
    -   Painful and error prone
-   Better to have the server return data as data
    -   Preferred format these days is [%g json "JSON" %]
    -   So common that `requests` has built-in support
-   There is no standard for representing tabular data as JSON
    -   A list with one list with column names + N lists of values
    -   A list with N dictionaries, all with the same keys
    -   A dictionary with column names and lists of values, all the same length

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="exercise" %]

[% exercise %]
Write a `requests` script that gets the current location and crew roster
of [the International Space Station][iss_api].

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="aside" title="Local Web Server" %]

[% single "src/run_local_server.sh" %]

-   Pushing files to GitHub so that we can use them is annoying
-   And we want to show how to make things *wrong* so that we can then make them *right*
-   Use Python's [`http.server`][py_http_server] module
    to run a [%g local_server "local server" %]
    -   Host name is [%g localhost "`localhost`" %]
    -   Uses [%g port "port" %] 8000 by default
    -   So URLs look like `http://localhost:8000/path/to/file`
-   `-d site` tells the server to use `site` as its root directory
-   Use this local server for the next few examples
    -   Build our own server later on to show how it works

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Talk to Local Server" %]

[% multi "src/requests_local_motto.py" "out/requests_local_motto.out" %]

-   [%g concurrency "Concurrent" %] systems are hard to debug
    -   Multiple streams of activity
    -   Order may change from run to run
-   Use `S` and `c` to show output from server and client respectively

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Our Own File Server" %]

[% single "src/file_server_unsafe.py" keep="do_get" %]

-   Our `RequestHandler` handles a single HTTP request
    -   More specifically, handles the `GET` method
-   Combine working directory with requested file path to get local path to file
-   Return that if it exists and is a file or raise an error

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Support Code" %]

-   Send content

[% single "src/file_server_unsafe.py" keep="send_content" %]

-   Handle errors

[% single "src/file_server_unsafe.py" keep="error_page" %]

[% single "src/file_server_unsafe.py" keep="handle_error" %]

-   Define our own exceptions so we're sure we're only catching what we expect

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Running Our File Server" %]

[% single "src/file_server_unsafe.py" keep="main" %]

-   And then get `motto.txt` as before

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Built-in Safety" %]

-   Modify `requests` script to take URL as command-line parameter

[% single "src/requests_local_url.py" %]

-   Add a sub-directory to `site` called `sandbox` with a file `example.txt`
-   Serve that sub-directory

[% single "src/file_server_sandbox.sh" %]

-   Can get files from that directory

[% multi "src/requests_local_url_allowed.sh" "out/file_server_allowed.out" "out/requests_local_url_allowed.out" %]

-   But not from parent directory (which isn't part of sandbox)

[% multi "src/requests_local_url_disallowed.sh" "out/file_server_disallowed.out" "out/requests_local_url_disallowed.out" %]

-   But why not?
-   Looks like `requests` is stripping the leading `..` off the path
-   And if we try that URL in the browser, same thing happens
-   So we're safe, right?

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Introducing netcat" %]

-   [`netcat`][netcat] (often just `nc`) is a computer networking tool
-   Open a connection, send exactly what the user types, and show exactly what is sent in response

[% multi "src/nc_localhost_8000.sh" "src/nc_allowed.text" "out/nc_allowed.out" %]

-   So far so good, but:

[% multi "src/nc_disallowed.text" "out/nc_disallowed.out" %]

-   We shouldn't be able to see files outside the sandbox
-   But if someone doesn't strip out the `..` characters, users can escape

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="exercise" %]

[% exercise %]
The shortcut <code>~<em>username</em></code> means "the specified user's home directory" in the shell,
while `~` on its own means "the current user's home directory".
create a file called `test.txt` in your home directory
and then try to get `~/test.txt` using your browser,
`requests`,
and Telnet.
What happens with each and why?

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="A Safer File Server" %]

[% single "src/file_server_safe.py" keep="handle_file" %]

-   [%g resolve_path "Resolve" %] the constructed path
-   Check that it's below the current working directory (i.e., the sandbox)
-   Fail if not
    -   Using `ServerException` guarantees that all errors are handled the same way

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="exercise" %]

[% exercise %]
[%g refactor "Refactor" %] the `do_GET` and `handle_file` methods in `RequestHandler`
so that all checks are in one place.
Does this make the code easier to understand overall?
Do you think making code easier to understand also makes it safer?

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Serving Data" %]

-   Rarely have JSON lying around as [%g static_file "static files" %]

[% multi "src/show_birds_csv.sh" "out/show_birds_csv.out" %]

-   Modify server to generate it dynamically
-   Main program

[% single "src/bird_server_whole.py" keep="main" %]

-   Create our own server class because we want to pass the dataframe in the constructor

[% single "src/bird_server_whole.py" keep="server" %]

-   `do_GET` converts the dataframe to JSON (will modify later to do more than this)

[% single "src/bird_server_whole.py" keep="get" %]

-   `send_content` [%g character_encoding "encodes" %] the JSON string as [%g utf_8 "UTF-8" %]
    and sets the MIME type to `application/json`

[% single "src/bird_server_whole.py" keep="send" %]

-   Can view in browser at `http://localhost:8000` or use `requests` to fetch as before

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Slicing Data" %]

-   URL can contain [%g query_parameter "query parameters" %]
-   Want `http://localhost:8000/?year=2021&species=rebnut` to select red-breasted nuthatches in 2021
-   Put slicing in a method of its own

[% single "src/bird_server_slice.py" keep="get" %]

-   Use `urlparse` and `parse_qs` from [`urllib.parse`][py_urllib_parse] to get query parameters
    -   (Key, list) dictionary
-   Then filter data as requested

[% single "src/bird_server_slice.py" keep="filter" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="exercise" %]

[% exercise %]
Write a function that takes a URL as input
and returns a dictionary whose keys are the query parameters' names
and whose values are lists of their values.
Do you now see why you should use the library function to do this?

[% exercise %]
Modify the server so that clients can specify which columns they want returned
as a comma-separated list of names.
If the client asks for a column that doesn't exist, ignore it.

[% exercise %]
Modify your solution to the previous exercise so that
if the client asks for a column that doesn't exist
the server returns a status code 400 (Bad Request)
and a JSON blog with two keys:
`status_code` (set to 400)
and `error_message` (set to something informative).
Explain why the server should return JSON rather than HTML in the case of an error.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="What's the Magic Word?" %]

-   Only allow access to data if client:
    -   [%g authentication "Authenticates" %] (i.e., establishes their identity)
    -   Is [%g authorization "authorized" %] (i.e., has the right to view the data)
-   Simplest possible is wrong in many ways: does the client know a password?

[% single "src/bird_client_password.py" %]
[% multi "src/bird_client_password_correct.sh" "out/bird_client_password_correct.out" %]
[% multi "src/bird_client_password_incorrect.sh" "out/bird_client_password_incorrect.out" %]

-   First change to server: get the password on the command line and save it

[% single "src/bird_server_password.py" keep="main" %]
[% single "src/bird_server_password.py" keep="server" %]

-   Second change: add authorization to `do_GET`
    -   Once again use our own exception class to handle unhappy cases

[% single "src/bird_server_password.py" keep="get" %]

-   Add authorization taht checks header value

[% single "src/bird_server_password.py" keep="auth" %]

-   Handle errors by constructing JSON

[% single "src/bird_server_password.py" keep="error" %]

-   It works but:
    -   One password for everyone
    -   Sent as [%g cleartext "cleartext" %] over an unencrypted connection

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Basic Authentication" %]

-   Modify `do_GET`

[% single "src/bird_server_basicauth.py" keep="get" %]

-   [Basic HTTP authentication][basic_http_auth]:
    -   Header called `"Authorization"`
    -   Value is <code>Basic <em>data</em></code>
    -   Data is [%g base64 "base-64 encoded" %] <code><em>username</em>:<em>password</em></code>
-   Most of the code is checking that everything is OK and responding properly if it's not
-   Test client

[% single "src/bird_client_basicauth.py" %]
[% single "src/bird_client_basicauth_correct.sh" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Securing the Server" %]

-   Two components
    -   Give the server a [%g digital_certificate "digital certificate" %] so that it can establish its identity
    -   Have the client communicate with it via [%g https HTTPS %] (the encrypted version of HTTP)
-   Certificate has private and public components
    -   Answer questions with '.' to skip
    -   `-nodes` is short for "no DES" so there isn't an interactive password on the certificate

[% single "src/create_pem.sh" %]
[% single "site/server_first_cert.pem" %]

-   Modify file server to listen for secure connections on port 1443
    -   [%g wrap_object "Wrap" %] the server's [%g socket "socket" %] with a layer of security
    -   Everything else stays the same

[% single "src/file_server_secure.py" keep="main" %]

-   Run it like this

[% single "src/file_server_secure.sh" %]

-   Point browser at `https://localhost:1443/motto.txt`
    -   Must have *both* `https` *and* the port `1443`

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Securing the Client" %]

-   Try `requests.get("https://localhost:1443/test.txt")`

[% single "out/requests_secure_no_verify.out" %]

-   Fair enough: `requests` shouldn't trust self-signed certificates by default
-   Can tell it not to check at all by passing `verify=False` but turning off security is a bad idea
-   Try `requests.get("https://localhost:1443/test.txt", verify="cert.pem")`
    -   I.e., pass it the server's certificate

[% single "out/requests_secure_server_cert.out" %]

-   What we actually need is to sign the server's certificate with a certificate from some authority,
    then tell `requests` it can use the authority's certificate to check the server's certificate
    -   Seems roundabout, but it allows us to use a few hundred trusted certificates to check everyone else's
-   `import certifi` and `certifi.where()` to see the PEM file that `requests` uses by default

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="topic" title="Starting Over" %]

-   Pretend to be our own [%g certificate_authority "certificate authority" %] (CA)
-   Use our CA certificate to [%g digial_signature "sign" %] the server's certificate
    -   We can use the CA to sign any number of certificates

[% single "src/create_signed_cert.sh" %]

-   Run the server with the newly-created certificate
-   Point `requests` at the CA certificate
    -   Which it then uses to check that the server's certificate is properly signed

[% single "src/requests_signed_cert.py" %]

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- -->
[% section_break class="aside" title="This Is Hard" %]

-   It took a full day and help from three other people to get this working
-   And I'm still not sure what these commands used to sign the server certificate are for

[% single "src/extfile.txt" %]

-   Some of this difficulty is intrinsinc: security really is hard
-   Some is accidental complexity introduced by evolution over time
